Roommate here.

Since our normal host for Bridge to Carpathia has done such a great job with the first two books, I volunteered myself to guest blog on the third book. Partially to provide a little break for her, but also to give you, dear reader, a slightly different spin on things.

You may be asking how you can be sure this isn’t just a trick. How can you know for sure that there’s actually a different author for this blog post? I don’t know. People think we’re the same person in real life already, so I don’t have anything new to offer on that topic.

Now, onto the main attraction.

*Nicolae*, the third book of the Left Behind series, covers the part of the story arc that follows our heroes through the Four Horsemen and the beginning of the terror that descends on Earth as part of the Seven Seals outlined in Revelation 6. For those who had to wait for the third book to be released back in 1997 after the massive cliffhanger ending of Book 2, the opening line does not disappoint.

<blockquote>It was the worst of times; it was the worst of times.</blockquote>

I think that tells us everything we need to know. 

You may remember that the end of Book 2 left us with Rayford and Amanda (newlyweds) living in New Babylon while Buck and Chloe (also newlyweds) were settling down in New York City. Turns out that was just a diversion because much of the book actually still takes place in Chicagoland. Way to psych us out, Jenkins. 

I did think about visiting some of these places to take selfies, but then it got cold out and I’m lazy so that didn’t happen. To make up for that, I decided I would do something equally as special for you, dear reader.

I am pleased to introduce our cast of cats:

As the book continues, it’s clear that LaHaye and Jenkins were really hoping to get a movie deal for their series. Cue numerous action sequences: bombings, explosions, multiple car chases that would make for a ridiculous action movie. (They were a little early on the apocalypse trend in popular culture, and alas, the movies that were actually made… well, I’m sure there will be a post on this later.)


Action Sequence #1:


US Militia forces rebelling against Potentate Nicolae Carpathia have taken the Nike center (which I thought was a giant Nike store until research for this post informed me that during the Cold War the USA armed a bunch of sites around the country with Nike anti-aircraft missiles, including a bunch in the Chicagoland area...that makes so much more sense). In response, Nicolae has the city of Chicago destroyed. Luckily Buck had purchased a fully-loaded Range Rover in anticipation of the violence, and luckily, Chloe was driving the Range Rover in the city when the bombs went off downtown.

Buck spends the better part of two chapters driving around Chicagoland in a borrowed car trying to find his wife. After destroying that car, he continues his search on foot.

Below is an image of the original cover of the 6th book, <em>Assassins</em>. It's very dramatic.

What does the title and cover mean? Well don't hurt yourself trying to figure it out, I'll help you out. The book is about everybody in (and even some people not in) the Tribulation Force wanting to and plotting to kill Carpathia. People really want to kill this dude. Even the people who know that he will just rise from the dead and resume antichrist-ing even more intensely afterwards. The book ends with Carpathia dead, lots of confusion, and David Hassid meeting with Carpathia's former ~~lover~~ right-hand man Supreme Commander Leon Fortunato (real title) identifying the assassin on video. But in Jenkins's best Shonda Rhimes imitation we are left in the dark as to who actually killed Carpathia!

I recently watched <em>Clue</em> so I am inspired to lay out the evidence for the potential assassin(s). (Also I feel guilty for not informing you all on the ridiculous going-ons of these books so hopefully I will be able to give you some plot synopsis this way.)

<h4>Crime Scene</h4>

Carpathia is killed during a gala that is supposed to celebrate something. It's supposed to last 5 days. On the second day he killed the two Wailing Wall dragons (sidenote: he actually called them dragons in this book, am I Carpathia???). Then there's a lot of debauchery and celebration and after a few days the dragons are resurrected and ascend into heaven after a loud voice yells, "COME UP HERE!" (this is actually true, God is like an angry mother). Anyways Carpathia is killed on stage as he is giving a speech after a loud gunshot. He has blood running from his eyes, nose, mouth, and top of his head. On the stage at the time of the gunshot are other Global Community dignataries, Leon Fortunato, and Chaim Rozenweig. Somewhere in the building/crowd is Rayford, Buck, Mac, and potentially Hattie and Abdullah.

<h4>Suspect Lineup</h4>

**Suspect #1, Rayford Steele:** The book starts with Rayford raging. This man has serious anger control issues. He has indicated his desire to be the one to kill Carpathia for several books now and holds Carpathia responsible for most of the deaths of his friends. He also has lost his sense of masculinity by being forced to go on the run, no longer being a major breadwinner of the Trib Force, and working for his daughter. As a result he does a lot of manual labor (digs Doc's grave by himself), yells at people, almost walks into a trap while trying to track down Hattie, obtains a black market technologically advanced gun called the Saber (this is important because LaHaye is a literalist and when the Bible says the Antichrist will die by a sword it must be some sort of "sword") and cost thousands of dollars, strands the newest member of the Tribulation Force in Belgium, and fails several times to shoot the gun at Carpathia when he is within shooting distance. The most damning evidence against Rayford is his rage and the fact that after being a coward and not shooting Carpathia he is jostled in the crowd and his gun goes off because it does not have a safety (cool cool whatevs, who needs gun control?). <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Strong.</em></b>

**Suspect #2, Buck Williams:** Buck left his wife and baby boy in Mount Prospect to go to the fancy Carpathia gala (I was in Mount Prospect this weekend, I don't blame him). We don't know of him having any gun in his possession and he definitely does not have the anger issues that Rayford has. Really he has no motive aside from the Antichrist thing and is on this list purely because he had opportunity by being in the front row of the audience. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Weak.</em></b>

**Suspect #3, Mac Whats-his-name:** Earlier in the book Mac and Abdullah save Fortunato's life by helping him escape an assassination attempt in Africa. It is then that we learn that he has a gun. Mac goes to the gala although Abdullah says he doesn't want to go. Mac vows to crash Carpathia's plane if Carpathia somehow survives the gala. Clearly he doesn't so it seems like Mac, the would-be assassin, does not get his chance to be the hero/villain/pawn. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Weak.</em></b>

**Suspect #4, Hattie Durham:** Hattie recovers from Carpathia's poisoning attempt but somehow she transfers the poisoning to Doc and that is how he dies (science is not LaHaye and Jenkins's forte). She acknowledges the truth of the Gospel but refuses to believe because she thinks she is too bad for salvation. She lives and regains her strength only so that she can kill Carpathia. After escaping Mount Prospect (there really is a theme here) she faked her death. But because she's an idito everyone knows that she's not actually dead. Leon Fortunato tells David Hassid that GC forces have captured her and she is in a prison of sorts in Belgium. But Rayford and Mac both think they see her in the crowd at the gala. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Strong.</em></b>

**Suspect #5, Abdullah Smith:** Like his captain, Mac, he has a pistol. He told Mac that he wasn't going to the gala but then is seen headed towards the gala with his hands suspiciously in his jacket pockets. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Strong.</b> Sadly partially because his name is Abdullah and I have a pretty good sense of Jenkins's political leanings.</em>

**Suspect(s) #6, Global Community potentates:** The assassination attempt that Mac and Abdullah save Fortunato from is actually an organized effort to kill Carpathia but he was not actually on the plane. Clearly there's dissent amongst the world leaders and Carpathia instructs Fortunato to get to the bottom of it. Fortunato doesn't learn much except there are some leaders who are anti-Carpathia including the Supreme Pontiff who dies of some virus but Carpathia uses his mind control to make people not care (the plot often doesn't make sense). Before Carpathia is shot three potentates behind him on stage kept on doing the wave (I don't know, ask Jenkins) and this left Nicolae confused and pissed. I think we are supposed to think that maybe some secular forces are behind Carpathia's assassination and the wave was some sort of signal. But it was so poorly written I really am not sure of much surrounding this plot point. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Confused.</em></b>

**Suspect #7, Chaim Rozenweig:** Chaim is like Hattie in that he basically believes Christianity is correct but not for him. He is pissed at Carpathia for screwing with Israel and lying to him and especially for ghosting him. For an old man he's a lot like a middle school girl. At one point he shows Buck his secret project which is the sharpest blade ever invented. He forces Buck to go to the gala for moral support even though no one understands why he wants to go to the gala in the first place. But he was also kind of but not really incapacitated by a big/small/not stroke earlier in the gala week. He uses a motorized wheelchair first for kicks and giggles and then because of said-strokish thing so he does not have to go through a metal detector. <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Strong.</em></b>

**Suspect #8, Leon Fortunato:** Leon is my favorite suspect. I like to imagine that he is the real Antichrist and everyone has been fooled into thinking Carpathia is the Antichrist. OR it's like a Dumbledore-Snape relationship. OR Leon Fortunato is the true hero of the series and has been undercover this whole time, I mean he <em>was</em> Amanda's cousin! <em><b>Strength of suspicion: Increasing.</em></b>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

**Moment of silence for the dead:** Doc, Dwayne and Trudy Tuttle (more pilots), Eli and Moishe (ish...), Carpathia??

**Answers for your pastor:**
Previously in this section I suggested that you ask your pastor if they would rather face one horse-sized locust demon monster or 100 locust-sized horse demon monsters. In the <em>Left Behind</em> series you don't have to choose! Book 5 features the latter and book 6 features the former! Also you can only see the big scary horses that breathe fire if you are a believer. Plus they won't hurt you and will actually protect you by killing your enemies with the smell of sulfur or incinerating them. So if you were a believer <em>obviously</em> you would choose the horse-sized locust demon monster. If your pastor told you differently look elsewhere for your biblical teaching, like maybe this series?...

**Current excitement level:** 7. WHO DUNNIT????

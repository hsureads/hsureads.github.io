While I have focused on conveying to you just how terrible the plot and character development of the **Left Behind** series are I feel that I have neglected to share the joys of reading Jenkins's writing. I will remedy that today with rants from yours truly regarding selected passages from the 5th book, **Apollyon**.

<h4>Terrible Writing Example #1: Conversation between Chloe and Buck</h4>

<blockquote>"What if Daddy tries to call? You know he had to be watching."
<br>"He can reach me on my phone."
<br>"Where is it?"
<br>"Agh! I left it in the van. I'll go get it."
<br>Now it was her turn to not let him go. "I'll just turn mine on," she said. "I don't want to be apart from you again right now either."
<br>Their mouths met, and he held her. They sat on the edge of the bed and lay back, her head reesting in the crook of his arm. Buck imagined how silly they looked, staring at the ceiling, feet flat on the floor. If she was as tired as he, it wouldn't be long before she nodded off. This probably wasn't the time to bring up a delicate subject, but Buck had never been known for his timing.</blockquote>

Agh indeed. Here we have Chloe again just nonchalantly referring to her father as "Daddy." [insert eyeroll] Also clear evidence that the 90's were a different time when you would actually turn off your phones. Mostly though, what in the world is with the sentence construction of "I don't want to be apart from you <em>again right now either</em>"?? So many superfluous words. And then "their mouths met"??? As I have already discussed, this is not a romance novel and yet somehow Jenkins makes kissing both explicit AND unromantic (more on this later). But don't worry all they do is lay back and stare at the ceiling with their feet flat on the floor. Which isn't weird except for the fact that Jenkins insists on describing it and writing about how Buck thinks it looks weird. Would it be less weird if their feet were up in the air? Or if they were staring elsewhere? I'm not sure how you lay on your back and look at anything but the ceiling. Anyways I digress, "what is the delicate subject?" you might be asking. I'm not really sure, I think it might be the fact that Chloe is pregnant. But I'm not sure what is so delicate about that and when is and isn't a good time to bring up an actual physical fact that probably is discussed fairly often. 

Back to the romance novel point, according to Wikipedia, Jerry B. Jenkins has actually written romance novels. While I am willing to undertake this **Left Behind** challenge I am unwilling to try to read one of his romance novels. We already know how he thinks <a href="https://hsureads.github.io/bridge-to-carpathia/2016/11/21/how-to-find-a-guy/">flirting and dating works</a>. Can you even imagine a whole book of that? Without any strange supernatural disasters and exciting car chases? No. Thank. You. Also, because I am such a thorough researcher I have discovered that in 2000 LaHaye and his wife wrote a book called <em>The Act of Marriage After 40: Making Love for Life</em>. If you are having trouble finding that version, it was updated in 2008 with the title <em>The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love</em> and now includes a section on "sex after sixty"! You are very welcome.

<h4>Terrible Writing Example #2: Conversation between Ken and Rayford</h4>

<blockquote>"[...]Wound up liking England; I <em>really<em> [emphasis Jenkins's, not mine] don't remember the whys of that now, but I knocked over London School of Economics with my high school records."
<br>"You did well in high school?"
<br>"Salutatorian, baby. Made the speech and everything. Thought I was gonna be an English teacher. I only talk like this 'cause it's easier, but yours truly is eminently cognizant of the grammatical parameters."
<br>"Amazing."
<br>"I amaze myself sometimes."
<br>"I'll bet you do."</blockquote>

This conversation is supposed to explain why Ken was smart enough to convert all of his cash to gold coins and bury them under his hut at the small airport he lives at. Yup. This whole book is a how-to book on being doomsday preppers. I imagine that Jenkins is pretty pleased with how this conversation came out, that he feels he wrote a multifaceted character in Ken and that Ken has a different conversational style than his other characters. Woo folksiness! Mostly I like to think about how LSE was "knocked over" by an American salutatorian who wanted to be an English teacher. Also I like to think that I hang out with a pretty erudite crowd but no one I know talks about their grammar knowledge and people definitely do not say "eminently cognizant of the grammatical parameters." That sounds like something a character from <em>The Big Bang Theory</em> would say, and we know that all of those nerds are representative of real nerds. Plus there has been no evidence that Ken doesn't know grammar and it's a pretty 1990s white middle-class belief to think that the knowledge of grammar equates to intellect. Don't even get me started on the universal grammar theory. AND THEN Rayford and Ken are both "amazed" by this revelation. I mean come on. I just can't.

<h4>Terrible Writing Example #3: Bo and Rayford have a showdown</h4>

<blockquote>Bo said, "And so you just thought you'd come by and see what you could make off with, is that it?"
<br>Rayford recoiled at such insensitivity, especially on the part of a stranger. "That's not it at all, sir. I--"
<br>"Where do you get off calling me <em>sir</em> (still not my emphasis)? You don't know me!"
<br>Caught off guard, Rayford's old nature took over. "What, am I talking to an alien? How does polite society refer to strangers on your planet, <em>Bo?<em>" He hit the name with as much sarcasm as he could muster. Rayford was much taller, but Bo was built like a linebacker. With his blond crewcut, he looked the part too.
<br>"Why don't you just take your opportunistic tail out of here while it's still part of your body?" Bo said.</blockquote>

It keeps on going like this. I don't have the energy to rant about this. But if I did I would present my theory about how Rayford might be off his rocker (look for this in a future post). My boyfriend and I have adopted this method of arguing though and find it quite effective.

<h4>Terrible Writing Example #4/Racist Example #1: Rayford doesn't know how to describe black people</h4>

<blockquote>"If your man leades Ernie here, I'll give him what for. We'll keep him from finding you, you can be sure of that. What's he driving, and what does he look like?"
<br>"The Rover and you."
<br>"Come back?"
<br>"He's driving Buck's Rover, and he looks a lot like you."</blockquote>

Rayford is talking on the phone to T (a new character who owns the airstrip that houses all of Ken's gold, T is not his full name). T is black. Rayford is prepping T for the arrival of Dr. Floyd Charles (or "Doc" as the characters like to call him... looks like I'm going to have to do a post on Jenkins's penchant for using nicknames soon) who is being tailed by Ernie, a teenager who is in love with Hattie and had the mark of a believer but is actually an imposter! Doc is also black. Apparently there are no other black people around the Palwaukee Airport area so merely knowing his skin color will be plenty to identify him. (I've done some extra research and the airport is real and in Wheeling, IL which in the 2010 census was only 2.44% African American, so there are definitely more than 2 but maybe they were all raptured?) Also don't most people say "come again?" and not "come back?"

Rest assured there is more writing like this. I'm sure I'll point out some choice passages in future books. If you're interested in the plot go read the Wikipedia. The high points are a helicopter escape, solar power is bad, there are lots of blizzards, demons take on the form of locust-sized horse monsters, weird layovers in Greece, a transatlantic charter flight on a fighter jet, and Chloe has a baby named Kenneth Bruce (awwwwwww).

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

**Moment of silence for the dead:** Ken Ritz

**Questions for your pastor:**
<ol>
<li>Would you rather face 1 horse-sized locust demon or 100 locust-sized horse demons?</li>
<li>What is a Christian romance novel like?</li>
</ol>

**Current excitement level:** 4. I'm going to try to power through books 6-10 before I head home for Christmas and save books 11-16 for the post-Christmas/pre-Inauguration stretch.

Do you think the world will end on January 20, 2017? Well in preparation for the apocalypse I have decided I will read all 16 books (!!!) of the *Left Behind* series prior to Trump's inauguration. Why would I do such a thing? Well for several reasons:
1. I have nothing better to do (let's be honest, this is probably the main reason)
2. It's topical! The world is ending AND my church is going through Revelation right now
3. I have always wanted to do a *Julie & Julia* type of challenge
4. Who knows when President-Elect Trump and the Republican Congress and the soon-to-be Conservative Supreme Court will begin banning books? Gotta read them all before then. I kid, I kid... I think.
Now that I've convinced you that this is a serious endeavor, you might be saying to yourself, "This girl is crazy. I can't read any more of this crap." Ok, but when you're facing interacting with your legitimately crazy in-laws this holiday season, I can be your escape and you know where to find me. If, however, like our hero ~~Nicholas Cage~~ Rayford Steele, you are ready to forge on and learn more, I present to you a primer on the series and my Bridge to Carpathia Challenge.
<h3>What is the *Left Behind* series?</h3>
The *Left Behind* series is a 16-part fiction series about the crap and terror that goes down when the Antichrist comes to power (depending on your political leanings that has already happened, #ThanksObama, or is beginning now, #MakeDonaldDrumpfAgain). Or as Wikipedia describes:
>*Left Behind* is a series of 17 best-selling novels by Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins, dealing with Christian dispensationalist End Times: the pretribulation, premillenial, Christian eschatological viewpoint of the end of the world.
Yeah ok, I don't want to unpack that. But here we come to the first unanswered question, are there 16 or 17 books? I have only found 16 books but maybe a.) I will power-up once I finish all 16 and gain special access to the 17th book, b.) it will be released once the actual Rapture happens, c.) the Nicholas Cage adaptation is actually a *National Treasure*/*Left Behind* mashup and Rayford Ben Steele Gates finds the 17th book at Monticello uncovering a Masonic conspiracy and reigniting his on-and-off-again relationship with Helen of Troy, ~~d.) I shouldn't rely on Wikipedia as my primary source.~~ Maybe you, like me, read the series when they released in the late 90's and early aughts. And perhaps you, like me, are thinking, "16?! I only read (insert number lower than 16 here)." Well there are 13 series novels and 3 prequels. They were not published in chronological order and after no debate whatsoever I have decided I will read the series novels followed by the prequels, God help me.
If you think that I should read a different series of apocalyptic fiction, I present to you the most compelling case of *Left Behind* as the most applicable apocalyptic literature I found on Wikipedia:
>The books were LaHaye's brainchild, though Jerry B. Jenkins, a former sportswriter with numerous other works of fiction to his name, did the actual writing of the books from LaHaye's notes. Jenkins has said, "I write the best I can. I know I'm never going to be revered as some classic writer. I don't claim to be C. S. Lewis. The literary-type writers, I admire them. I wish I was smart enough to write a book that's hard to read, you know?"
AND
>Jerry Falwell said about the first book in the series: "In terms of its impact on Christianity, it's probably greater than that of any other book in modern times, outside the Bible."
I rest my case. ~~I also rest my case that both Senior and Junior Falwells have no idea what they're talking about.~~
And don't forget that there are four movies based on the series (that I will probably end up watching). Three starring Kirk Cameron and one (I assume) masterful movie starring Nicholas Cage and Chad Michael Murray.
<h3>How will this blog work?</h3>
I will still post my favorite articles every week. But I will also write a blog post for every Left Behind novel I read as we approach Trump's inauguration (that's 16 books in 65 days or approximately a book every 4 days). I have no idea what these posts will look like although I am pretty confident that you can look forward to my existential crisis around books 8-14 and increasingly prevalent manic run-on sentences as January 20, 2017 approaches. Also I will probably be live-tweeting some of my reactions with the hashtag #BridgetoCarpathia (if you've never read the book, I will explain the name later). If you also are a glutton for punishment and a Trump presidency is not a nightmare enough for you, I would not recommend it, but I guess you can join me in this challenge (my roommate is already on *Nicolae*, that's book 3 for you heathens). See you on the other side.

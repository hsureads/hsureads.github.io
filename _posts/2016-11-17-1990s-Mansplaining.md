I finished *Left Behind* this afternoon. Reading such a masterpiece was a little painful at first but once the plot got moving it was bearable. The constant thought running through my head was, "I am in the mind of a slightly past mid-life crisis father." Don't worry, we will get to my psychoanalysis of LaHaye and Jenkins based on this book, but first I will summarize the book for you. So if you are hoping to read the series later then you might want to reconsider following this blog but you should also reconsider your reading list. If you decide to ignore my spoiler alert then on to my summary!

<h3>Storylines</h3>

**The Rapture**: It is very clearly the 1990s. Several of our main characters are on an airplane over the Atlantic when the rapture happens. A bunch of the people on the plane disappear, leaving piles of clothes behind them. The married pilot, Rayford Steele, was planning on wandering the plane to hit on a flight attendant, Hattie Durham, but quickly pivoted once he realized ~~there might be naked people all over the plane~~ something catastrophic happened. Meanwhile because 9/11 has not happened yet it's pretty much okay that Buck Williams, a hotshot journalist, is rewiring the in-seat phone to contact his editor in New York with something that seems like email but not specifically named email and involving a "computer address." When they get back to Chicago it's madness because people have disappeared all over the place... What is going on?!

**Rayford's storyline**: Rayford gets home to find his crazy Jesus freak of a wife and his vanilla son are among those who have disappeared. He knows his daughter is ok thanks to an answering machine but since call-waiting wasn't a thing (really?) can't get in touch with her. Rayford's nagging wife apparently went to a church that mostly preached about the rapture (what?) so Rayford has a sinking feeling in his stomach that he knows what happened. Thanks to Bruce Barnes, a church staffer who didn't actually believe, and the magic of VHS tapes Rayford accepts Jesus into his heart (AKA the hopes and dreams of many a Veggietales producer). He and Bruce team up to convert everyone and anyone they can talk to and fight evil (AKA the dream of many a LarryBoy producer).

**Chloe's storyline**: Rayford's daughter, Chloe, makes it home after many connecting flights. She mostly just tags along with her dad on his errands and his work. She eventually believes in God after becoming increasingly weepy. Also she's into Buck.

**Buck's storyline**: Buck was on his way to London to interview a source before the rapture happened. His source dies, he goes to investigate, the Scotland Yard guy he meets with dies in a car explosion, most people think Buck dies, but no! he's fine and back in New York, but wanted for murder in both cases!, then magically cleared of all charges but a competitor also dies in the meantime, then he develops a crush on Chloe despite a ten year age difference and terrible timing, gets a big promotion, meets the dreamteam of Rayford and Bruce, may ~~or may not~~ have witnessed two other murders, gets like 5 demotions, but gets the biggist promotion of all joining forces with R, B, and C and moving to Chicago. Also spends a lot of time on various phones of all kinds (airplane phones, pay phones, cell phones, and "portable phones"). Phew. Buck is Jack Bauer.

**Hattie's storyline**: Hattie was into Rayford. But gasp, she rebuffs his efforts to share the gospel after he tells her, "I was only into you physically. But now I care about your soul" (essentially). She has a crush on the Antichrist and meets him thanks to Buck and thanks to being attractive (#thanksobama). The Antichrist hires her as a "personal assistant" (assisting on what, amirite?).

**Antichrist's storyline**: Nicolae Carpathia is the Antichrist. He's super attractive and European and seemingly super into world peace and cooperation. He decides the UN is the best way to achieve world domination (read as: does not understand bureaucracy). He has some suspicious links to powerful rich people but kills said powerful rich people and wipes the memory of people not named Buck. Also was considerate enough to tell Hattie to scoot back so as to not get blood and guts splattered on her.

Yup. I think this is all supposed to happen within a week or so. Lesson: the apocalypse moves fast. There are also two weirdos preaching at the Wailing Wall.

<h3>Psychoanalysis</h3>
Why did I feel like I was being mansplained to? The whole book feels like a dad's dream. See my character analyses below:
<ul>
<li>Rayford: A manifestation of the guy LaHaye and Jenkins would want to be. Decently good looking, working in a seemingly glamorous and powerful profession. His flaw is that he was considering cheating on his wife. The "drop dead gorgeous" flight attendant was interested but he didn't have enough game to act on it. He's a leader and an alpha male. Drives a BMW. Has a flawed but not deeply flawed family. <em>See Chloe, Buck, and Raptured Family entries.</em></li>

<li>Chloe: The daughter that takes after her father and still calls him "daddy" at 20. She goes to Stanford University but loves him so much that she comes home immediately after the rapture and enrolls in local classes (maybe Oakton Community College, hopefully Northwestern University). She is independent enough to make her own decisions but is a good obedient daughter and loves to hang out with her dad and of her own logic comes to believe what her father believes, naturally.</li>

<li>Buck: The dream son-in-law. Successful, handy with electronics and tools, mature, has money, complicated relationship with his own family so he can more readily integrate into her family - eventually.</li>

<li>Hattie: Super attractive and somehow attracted to a guy 15 years older than her. Luckily for Rayford LaHaye Jenkins, after he decides not to pursue her, she turns out to be an emotional ditz. Yuck. Rayford dodged that attractive bullet.</li>

<li>Antichrist: Of course the <strike>rebound guy</strike> Antichrist will be super attractive and that ditzy flight attendant will fall for him (this is the first of many clues that if LaHaye and Jenkins are right about the end times Trump cannot be the Antichrist). </li>

<li>Raptured Family: Rayford's wife made cookies regularly. Ray Jr. was a good kid and named after Rayford. Those are the only traits I remember but honestly they also seem like traits that a man would want out of his raptured family.</li>
</ul>

This, plus the way each character talked about their conversion, just seemed like a pastor trying to explain Christianity to me. Not very convincingly either. I can't believe that anyone outside of the church read these books.

<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>

**Questions for your pastor:**
<ol>
<li>Will the Antichrist come from Europe?</li>
<li>Is the EU evil?</li>
<li>Is Brexit an effort to fight against evil? Is it proof that end times are near or that we've got some more time?</li>
<li>Do you have a post-rapture VHS? Shouldn't you get that burned onto a DVD?</li>
</ol>

**Current excitement level:** 8. Like our heroes I know the pain and tribulation that lies before me, but I also know the reward. Bring it on.

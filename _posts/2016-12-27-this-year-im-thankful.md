It has been brought to my attention that this blog is mostly just me being angry. In fact it was suggested that I change the name of this blog to "Ranty McRanterson." That suggestion is currently under consideration. But for some balance I have decided to try to list the things that I like/enjoy/appreciate/[insert some neutral/positive verb here]. I predict this will be a difficult task but one I am willing to undertake.

<ul>
<li><b>Jenkins seems to have done some research:</b> While he clearly was not very technologically advanced and cannot describe any sort of technology, since 95% of Star Alliance's members are in the aviation business he does seem to know a bit about planes. Various types of planes are described and used throughout the series. I can appreciate that Jenkins fleshed out his pilots' worlds and experiences. If only he had afforded the same amount of attention to other topics.</li>
<li><b>Bringing new words into my life:</b> Jenkins would probably like to think of himself like Ken Ritz, "I only talk(/write) like this 'cause it's easier, but yours truly is eminently cognizant of the grammatical parameters." I maintain that knowing grammar does that qualify you to be a writer or indicate any level of intelligence but it seems that (for the most part) Jenkins knows grammar. He also sometimes includes multi-syllabic words to indicate his vast vocabulary. For instance, I had to look up "bivouac." The unfortunate thing is that he likes to use the same advanced words all the time. He's always writing about troops being <em>mustered</em>, how <em>obsequious</em> people are, and the <em>bivouac</em> living structures in Petra. I will never forget these words and the various ways they can be used to describe the same thing over and over again.</li>
<li><b>A sense of accomplishment:</b> Have you read ten books this year? I've read ten books in the past month. Do I get embarrassed when I go to the library to pick up the latest <em>Left Behind</em>? Yes, so much so that I do my best to avoid human interaction, thank God my library has an app where you can check out books from a dark corner where no one will wander in and see that I have 15 pounds of Left Behind in my backpack. But it feels good to have read so many books as long as I don't dwell on it for too long.</li>
<li><b>I have a whole new conversational style now:</b> When I don't agree with someone I accuse them of being an alien. After a fight or not-so-fight with my boyfriend I know to ask if we are in love again. Badgering people is an effective evangelistic technique.</li>
<li><b>I have a definitive list of names I would never name my children:</b> Rayford Steele, Buck Williams, Mac McCullum, Kenny Bruce, Pinkerton Stephens, Hattie Durham, Tyrola Mark Delanty, Viv Ivins, etc. Not only because I have terrible connotations with these names now but because I think many of them are objectively terrible names.
<li><b>I have a working knowledge of basic HTML:</b> Basic. But it's there and much more than it was previously.</li></ul>

I don't think I succeeded in preventing myself from ranting but 2017 is starting soon and we all have higher hopes for next year right?

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p><b>Moment of silence for the dead:</b> Oh who even knows any more. I finished this book 10+ days ago.</p>

<p><b>Questions for your pastor:</b></p>
<ol>
<li>How would you counsel a friend of a friend who finds herself in a ranty rut because of an ill-advised self-imposed premillenial, pretribulation novel challenge?</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Current excitement level:</b> 2. I finished <em>The Remnant</em> prior to going home for Christmas. I wrote most of this post before I got home but then got home and had no desire to go on the internet and definitely no interest in thinking about <em>Left Behind</em>. Now I'm on my way back and dreading returning to that world even more than before. I don't think I'll be reading those prequels.</p>

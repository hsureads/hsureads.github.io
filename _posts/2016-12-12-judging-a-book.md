Lacking my normal Trello board of potential blog posts about the 8th book, <em>The Mark</em>, largely due to my laziness and desire to just freaking finish these books, I was scrambling for ideas of what to write about. But then I looked at the physical book and was inspired. 

<p><img src="/images/left-behind-mark.jpg" alt="creepy eye" style="width:100%;"></p>

I mean what beautiful cover art, how could you not be inspired. I don't want to only critique the writing and plot but also the physical manifestation of the <em>Left Behind</em> series. Therefore here is a dissection of the book dust jacket of <em>The Mark</em>.

<h3>The Title and Subtitle</h3>
<em>The Mark: The Beast Rules the World</em>

The title and subtitle set the stage for the book and set your expectations. It is important that it's not just called <em>Mark</em> because then we might get carried away and think that this is actually part of the New Testament. The "mark" is actually in reference to the beast's mark which is now being required of all remaining citizens of the earth (I'll explain the plot a little later when we get to the inside of the book jacket). For further emphasis on the non-Biblical nature of the title and the scariness of what lies within the book jacket there is the ominous subtitle. I believe the effect here is supposed to be DUN DUN DUNNNNNNNNN!!!!!

<h3>The Artwork/Colorscheme</h3>
The gold and purple are clear indications of royalty. Carpathia, now risen from the dead, is ruler and deity of the world. People kiss his ring and kneel before him. There are replicas of that giant naked statue being <strike>erected</strike> built all around the world. Then there's the image itself which is some facsimile of the hardware of a computer chip. The mark itself takes the form of a "biochip" inserted into each person's body along with a tattoo. And finally there's the eye in the corner. Whose eye do we think it belongs to? Is it Carpathia/Satan looking at us? Maybe it's God keeping a watchful eye? Perhaps it represents Rayford who doesn't trust anyone? I would say it was David Hassid since he likes to bug every single room he can (even people's hotel rooms) and listen in to their conversation but he's Israeli and evidently has dark skin. This eye's surrounding skin looks really white to me. My bet is that it's supposed to add to the ominous cover as a whole and represents Carpathia because I really don't think the artists and editors at Tyndale House Publishers are really that complex.

<h3>Back Cover</h3>
Here we have a photo featuring LaHaye and Jenkins. Jenkins (the dude with the white hair) looks quite happy. LaHaye smiles like a lot of dads I know who don't actually like being in pictures and haven't quite figured out how to look serious and manly while also smiling on cue. It seems they are posing at some university or church and I like to think that there was a wedding going on and they just swooped in and asked the wedding photographer to snap some pictures for them. If LaHaye angled his body towards Jenkins it really would look like a couple-y picture, just saying.

<h3>Inside Jacket Cover Description</h3>
This book cost $22.99. Seriously. That's in 2000 dollars too! And if you bought all 13 hardcovers? You could have spent that money on actually funding a missionary or something but whatever, terrible apocalyptic religious fiction is good too.

There is also the book description which probably wasn't written by Jenkins but man the writing is as great as I have come to expect. There are a lot of plots so there are a lot of paragraphs. I'll break them down for you.

<blockquote>His Excellency Global Community Potetate Nicolae Carpathia is back, this time as Satan. Resurrected and indwelt by the devil himself, it's no more Mr. Nice Guy as the beast tightens his grip as ruler of the world.</blockquote>

I just love that it's written like a parody movie trailer. I don't think I've ever heard the phrase "It's no more Mr. Nice Guy" except ironically. Which I suppose it's kind of ironic here but in the wrong direction. Oh well.

<blockquote>Esconced in a new safe house, the Tribulation Force suffers tragic loss at the dawn of the second half of the seven-year Tribulation, the Great Tribulation.</blockquote>

An excellent SAT writing sample if I do say so myself. The problem is I'm not sure what tragic loss they are talking about. The people who die in this book are not at the safe house. Most likely they are referring to Annie dying by lightning strike in New Babylon. This saddens her secret fiance David Hassid greatly.

<blockquote>Rayford and a suspicious colleague jet west on a mission of mercy with shocking results.</blockquote>

Rayford is suspicious of Albie. No one else is suspicious of Albie, including any readers. The only thing suspicious is the fact that the Power Rangers are basically Star Alliance. Every country they go to they suddenly find pilot friends. The mission they are going on is the mission to save Hattie (AKA Star Alliance's founding mission). They eventually find her and Buck's old (now-disfigured but also now a believer) boss. They rescue Hattie but leave the crippled boss and suspicious Albie is able to convert Hattie. I swear the Star Alliance are the most successful evangelists ever. I think they have a 99% success rate. The only failure was Rayford's ludicrous attempt to badger the Antichrist into becoming a Christian. Who's the idiot now?

<blockquote>Terror comes to the believers in Greece as they are among the first to face a GC loyalty mark application site and its benignly named but hideous death contraption, the loyalty enforcement facilitator.</blockquote>

In my world that the benignly named but hideous death contraption is a library filled with only <em>Left Behind</em> books. But alas what keeps Jenkins up at night are guillotines. Buck and Albie witness a bunch of their Grecian brothers and sisters die by guillotine although they do succeed in saving two of them. I'm not actually sure that they are safe because Star Alliance's customer service is subpar and Buck and Albie basically just help them escape from prison but then leave them to fend for themselves, they don't even escort them off of GC property. Also it seems like GC loyalty mark application sites are unlike any other government offices in that they are extremely efficient. So I'm rather impressed by this Carpathia dude, he's like the Mussolini and makes the trains run on time.

<blockquote>The Trib Force moles inside the palace in New Babylon face tragedy and danger, and they must flee, take the mark, or suffer the consequences.</blockquote>

Annie is dead. David split his head open after getting heatstroke but meets a Native American believer named Hannah Palemoon and he throws up on Carpathia instead of worshipping him (the benefits of concussions). Together with Star Alliance Pilots #78 and #79 they stage a plane crash but are escaping to the Star Alliance's headquarters in Chicago. They leave behind Asian Stereotype #4 who is a prodigy at everything (particularly math and computers) except social interactions who bears both the mark of the beast and the Christian mark. Because he was forced by his terrible father to get the mark of the beast, it doesn't count against him. He's now the single mole left in New Babylon (that we know of).

<blockquote>Meanwhile, Carpathia plans his overt attack on the so-called Judah-ites, while the Trib Force gears up for its most ambitious countermeasures ever.</blockquote>

Buck and Chaim are on their way to Jerusalem to set up the safe haven for Jews. Chaim was depressed but somehow was encouraged by Hattie. The rest of the Star Alliance is flying around like they're meant to do.

<blockquote>The gloves are off, and the battle is launched between the forces of good and evil for the very souls of men and women around the globe.</blockquote>

"The gloves are off." Jenkins, is that you? Probably not, if it was, you would have called it a "cosmic battle." Oh well, a girl can dream (not quite like <a href="https://hsureads.github.io/bridge-to-carpathia/2016/12/09/things-that-made-me-cry/">Tsion and his drug-induced Harry Potter dreams</a>, but on a smaller more earthbound scale).

<h3>Selected Reviews from the Back Inside Cover</h3>
<blockquote>"Christian thriller. Prophecy-based fiction. Juiced-up morality tale. Call it what you like, the Left Behind series-seven books thus far-now has a label its creators could never have predicted: blockbuster success."-Entertainment Weekly</blockquote>

Does that make anyone want to read the series? They need some new marketing folks over at Tyndale.

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p><b>Moment of silence for the dead:</b> Annie, Grecian congregation</p>

<p><b>Weird moral dilemma:</b></p>
I found Jerry B Jenkins on Twitter and tweeted at him. He liked my tweet... Should I continue to badger him with my blog coverage or play nice? According to his Twitter he does not take offense when people criticize his work.

<p><b>Current excitement level:</b> 4. 2 more books before I get a break.</p>

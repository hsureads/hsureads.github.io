As we get closer to January 20 I must admit that Carpathia seems a little more like Trump everyday. So let's play a little game of who said it.

<h4><em>"Who is asking? And why do you not address me with a title of honor?"</em></h4>

Carpathia. But it's only a matter of days before Trump says it. Also I'm not following the press conference today but I could totally see him responding to a question from the media like that.

<h4><em>"Any other dissidents? Anyone who would rather be dead than suffer for the cause?"</em></h4>

Carpathia. He just killed a GC leader with his bare hands during a meeting. We have no idea what goes on in Trump Tower but piecing together what we know (e.g. Trump's hands are too small to kill a full-grown human), it's probably not this... Yet.

<h4><em>"I want someone assigned who can put an end to this. What will people think?"</em></h4>

I imagine this is Trump after each scandal and prior to each angry tweet. But it's Carpathia and he's angry about the television coverage being hijacked and not staying on message. Hmmm. Seems Trump-ish.

<h4><em>"Tomorrow, in a highly secure, private meeting, I will outline my marvelous, truly inspired plan to once and for all lead us to our goal of true global harmony."</em></h4>

It's Carpathia but I had you until "true global harmony" didn't I? "Highly secure, private meeting" does sound like how Trump would describe some intelligence meeting, if he ever admitted to sitting through one. He, like Carpathia, does like to boast of his amazing secret plans. Do you think Jerry B. Jenkins knows Trump? This characterization is better than expected.

<h4><em>"Down to business. Let me begin by reminding you that this is not a democracy. We are not here to vote, and neither are you here to give me input. If there is something you believe I need to know, feel free to say so. If you have a problem with my leadership or have any questions about why I have done anything or about the plans I will reveal today, I remind you of the disposition of the three former potentates to the south who have been replaced due to their untimely deaths."</em></h4>

Carpathia. But this exercise in humor is becoming less and less humorous...

<h4><em>"Please meet Ashtaroth, Baal, and Cankerworm. They are the most convincing and persuasive spirits it has ever been my pleasure to know."</em></h4>

Carpathia and this one's obvious since there is no way that Trump has friends that have such interesting and non-white names. Back on track, say it with me, "Trump is not Carpathia. Trump is not Carpathia."

<h4><em>"I come to offer pardon. I am willing to compromise. I wish you no ill."</em></h4>

Carpathia. Wait... I know Carpathia is lying here but should I be concerned that the Antichrist seems nicer than our President-elect?

<h4><em>"Grab 'em by the *****."</em></h4>

Oh crap.

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p><b>Moment of silence for the dead:</b> Chloe, Albie, Tsion, and someone in the last paragraph but I can't figure out who because the writing is just that great.</p>

<p><b>Current excitement level:</b> 3. Returning to the <em>Left Behind</em> world was pretty painful. But there are only two books remaining! This excitement is offset but the deep depression that writing this post has put me in. So there's that.

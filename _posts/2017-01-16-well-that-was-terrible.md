I had no strong feelings about this book. It was more of the same, except Jesus appears and Carpathia and Fortunato are sent to Hell. But Jenkins does not know how to write action scenes any more than he knows how to write romantic relationships so it was not that exciting. I think the most exciting thing that happened in the twelfth book was that Mac was in blackface almost the entire time. That was definitely exciting for all the wrong reasons and completely unnecessary. How unfortunate and yet unsurprising that the book that was supposed to end the series was anti-climactic. I think this book drained all the humor out of me. I must forge ahead to finish the series and this horrible chapter of my life.

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p><b>Moment of silence for the dead:</b> Turns out it was Buck that was dead in the previous book. But everyone's alive again so wooo.</p>

<p><b>Current excitement level:</b> 2. 1. More. Book.

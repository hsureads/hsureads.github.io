Since picking up the first <em>Left Behind</em> book I have been often dreamcasting the roles in my head (and often aloud, this series really has taken over my life). It doesn't matter that there have already been 4 films based on the series. Like Nicholas Cage, I think I can do it better. While I usually like to cast it as a comeback vehicle for former A-List actors who have disappeared a bit (i.e. Frankie Muniz as Buck and Hayden Christensen <strike>reprising his star turn</strike> as <strike>Darth Vader</strike> Carpathia) in the spirit of the Christmas season I have decided to cast <em>The Muppets Left Behind</em>. Furry alien-ish comedic puppets seems like the appropriate actors for <em>Left Behind</em>.

Note: This casting is taking place after the failed television revival. In said revival Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy broke up so all romantic pairings are fair game.

<ul>
<li><b>Animal as Rayford Steele:</b> In a shocking break with tradition, Kermit the Frog is relieved of his leading man duties. Stepping in from the wings is Animal who possesses the craziness that Rayford requires. Also just imagine a movie where Animal has to move the plot forward. I think he would make a great pilot as well.</li>
<li><b>Rowlf the Dog as Cameron "Buck" Williams:</b> When thinking about the Muppets characters, the muppet that most resembles Kirk Cameron to me is Rowlf the Dog. That is the only criterion I needed to cast him as the other male lead. But I'll rationalize the decision to producers by saying he's generally likeable and will play the straight man to Animal's literally insane man.</li>
<li><b>Camilla the Chicken as Chloe Steele Williams:</b> We all know who Miss Piggy is going to play which leaves us with Camilla the Chicken as the other main female role. Sorry Gonzo, Rowlf gets the chick(en) (I'm so sorry) this time. I don't know how dogs and chickens reproduce so who knows who will play Kenny but whatever.</li>
<li><b>Sam Eagle as Tsion Ben-Judah:</b> Sam Eagle was in the running to be Rayford Steele but in the end the guy who makes the most sermons and preaches the most is Tsion. Also a movie led by Sam Eagle sounds unbearable. Anyways Sam Eagle is always lecturing so he seems like he'd make a great pastor.</li>
<li><b>Gonzo as Nicolae Satan Carpathia:</b> Gonzo has illusions of grandeur. His species is also not clear. What a perfect muppet for the Antichrist/evil human who takes over the world.</li>
<li><b>Pepe the King Prawn as Leon Fortunato:</b> Described on Wikipedia as "a scheming and sassy Latino king prawn." I rest my case.
<li><b>Miss Piggy as Hattie Durham:</b> I am sorry to continue with the typecasting but it's just too perfect. Also Hattie gets burnt to a crisp in book 9, <em>Desecration</em>, and we all love bacon.</li>
<li><b>Kermit the Frog as Dr. Chaim Rozenweig:</b> Kermit gets his revenge. He plays the stealth hero. While not terribly important during the first 7 books Chaim comes into his own by being the one to kill Carpathia and in the 9th book he is chosen to lead the Jews to a safe haven in Petra.</li>
<li><b>Bunsen Honeydew and Beaker as Hannah Palemoon and Leah Rose:</b> Hannah and Leah as nurses (why can't women be doctors?) are the closest things to scientists the <em>Left Behind</em> series have. And for some odd reason Leah is always in the way of other characters. Actually she's not, but people just get pissed at her all the time.
<li><b>Fozzie Bear as David Hassid:</b> Fozzie Bear needs a role because he's adorable. He could probably pull of Polish-Israeli computer geek.</li>
<li><b>Bean Bunny as Chang Wong:</b> I think the Muppets don't really have ages but Bean Bunny seems young and naive. There's a dark moment in the 9th book where Chang wants to kill himself which will be a moment for Bean Bunny to show his dramatic acting chops.</li>
<li><b>The Swedish Chef as Albie:</b> LaHaye and Jenkins can't write other nationalities or ethinicities for crap. A puppet speaking mock Swedish seems like a good fit for a foreigner who often doesn't get American idioms and is suspected by Rayford despite not being suspicious at all.</li>
<li><b>Statler and Waldorf as the Wailing Wall crazies:</b> Old guys who yell a lot.</li>
</ul>

Quick rundown of book 9 plot: Carpathia rode a pig into the Jerusalem temple and slaughtered it there, people with Carpathia's mark now have a terrible rash that incapacitates them, Chloe discovers a group of believers in a Chicago currency exchange, some dude named George has been captured by some Greeks because those Greeks that Albie and Buck freed got caught because Albie and Buck are the worst heroes ever, Carpathia is killing people left and right, there's a large gathering of Jews in the desert

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p><b>Moment of silence for the dead:</b>David, Laslos, not-so-freed Greek boy, Hattie</p>

<p><b>Current excitement level:</b> 6. The muppets are fun.</p>

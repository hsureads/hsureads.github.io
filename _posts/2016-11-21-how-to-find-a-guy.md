*Tribulation Force* was a scary look into Christian courtship rituals. I have outlined the steps to finding The One during the End Times as told by LaHaye and Jenkins. Fingers crossed this gets turned into the fourth Gosling-Stone romantic dramedy.

**Step One:** Remain pure. You may be beyond redemption if you have had sex before marriage. Even if you did not become a Christian until your early 30s and are a supposed good-looking, globe-trotting, hotshot journalist (hello Buck). Or if you are a not-so-rebellious rebellious wild daughter who got into the crazy party school of Stanford University (hi Chloe). I hope you had enough foresight to live by Christian values before you became a Christian.
<br>**Step Two:** Develop a crush but doubt your feelings. Is the Apocalypse the right time to even think about romance? You've never been good at love anyways.
**Step Three:** Show your interest. Men, wipe some chocolate off of your crush's mouth and then eat it. Don't worry, this is totally fine and acceptable if you just met them. Women, swoon at second-hand chocolate consumption.
Step Four: Rescind your interest. Ignore your crush as you wrestle with you doubts (see Step Two). Repeat steps 3 and 4 as necessary to increase tension and intrigue.
**Step Five:** Engage in a romantic-comedy of errors. (See the plot of *Top Hat* but alas with less dancing.)
**Step Six:** Apologize with a grand gesture. Both parties are at fault for not actually communicating, assuming interest, assuming dis-interest, accusing each other of a secret fiance, guessing at secret meanings of flowers, etc. Grand gesture should come from the man and the woman should at first petulantly refuse said gesture and then accept and swoon. Instructions for background players: Dad should eavesdrop.
**Step Seven:** Go on a walk and talk about your sexual prowess, or lack thereof. See Step One.
**Step Eight:** Lengthy awkward flirting, often in the presence of friends and family.
<blockquote>"I don't know where I'd be without you people."
<br>"Us people?" She smiled. "You couldn't have left the last word off that sentence, could you?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Whoever's in love with your daughter sure has good taste," Buck said [to Rayford]
<br>"Thank you," Chloe said.
<br>"I mean good taste in chocolate mints."
<br>Chloe blushed. "I know what you meant," she said.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Now sit down and relax and pretend you're a frequent worldwide traveler."
<br>"I wish for once I could pretend I'm not."
<br>"And then you'd be nervous about the flight and need me here?"
<br>"I need you here anyway."
<br>She looked away. <em>Slow down</em>, he told himself. This was the fun part, the parrying stage, but it was also maddeningly uncertain.</blockquote>
**Step Nine:** Commence long-distance cookie sharing ritual. Buy cookies together in the airport terminal and promise to eat them at the exact same time. Helpful if one person is on national television at pre-arranged cookie eating time so the other person can verify the ritual was performed satisfactorily. If the girl is really into the guy she should smile, cry, and eat to indicate true love. For added drama, meddling father can threaten to eat the love cookie.
**Step Ten:** Think that Mr. Virgin is dead. Long distance relationships are hard. They were even harder in 1996 when no one had cell phones and two crazies at the Wailing Wall were killing people from breathing fire from their mouths while your beloved boyfriend of a week was standing a couple yards away on tv!
**Step Eleven:** Reassure your cookie partner that you are alive then tell them you are going to see the 2 Wailing Wall dragons once your cookie partner has calmed down. They will feel very reassured.
**Step Twelve:** Test the limits of your new relationship by moving away. While saying goodbye also admit that you love each other. It is only after love has been agreed to that you may kiss. As the girl tries to respond to the man's proclamation he is to repeatedly kiss her to shut her up.
**Step Thirteen:** Go on double date with the cookie thief dad and his new love interest who is the exact opposite of flight attendant bimbo.
**Step Fourteen:** Many months later get engaged simultaneously with cookie thief and substitute mother figure.
**Step Fifteen:** Two weeks later get married at a joint ceremony.
**Step Sixteen:** Women quit their jobs to follow their powerful husbands around. It is unknown if they consumate their marriages, this is a Christian book not a romance novel.

So that's where we are now. Buck and Chloe are married. Rayford is married to a woman named Amanda White who knew his wife before the rapture. After officiating their wedding(s) Bruce the pastor died. Also the Wailing Wall dragons are actually Elijah and Moses, Hattie is having Carpathia's child (out of wedlock no less!), Buck and Rayford now work for Carpathia, all of the world religions have formed one religion, the UN is now called the Global Community, there are only state-run press publications, and World War III happened (don't worry, the US was on the good side but still lost #thanksobama).

<h4>Closing thoughts</h4>
**Questions for your pastor:**
<ol>
<li>My dad doesn't meddle in my relationship, does he still love me?</li>
<li>Do you give discounts for joint wedding officiating??</li>
<li>Are the cookies included or sold separately when I sign up for the singles mixer?</li>
</ol>

**Current excitement level:** 8. There was a lot of groaning while reading this book but I'm hoping that now the main characters have paired off I won't have to read any more of this garbage and it will all be action and martyrdom. Plus how can you not get excited for the following books when this one ends with this dramatic cliffhanger, <blockquote>The Red Horse of the Apocalypse was on the loose.</blockquote>

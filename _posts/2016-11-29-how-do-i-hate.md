I'm starting to falter and it's only book 4. In this pessimistic mood I have decided to illustrate how great Jenkins and LaHaye are at character development by counting the ways that Carpathia is evil and thus the Antichrist.

<ol>
<li>Doesn't play by the rules. Example: wins People's Sexiest Man Alive designation less than a year after the previous sexy man was awarded.</li>
<li>Cold-blooded murderer. Killed his corrupt financiers in <em>Left Behind.</em></li>
<li>Uncontrollable rage. Really wants someone to kill the two Wailing Wall Wackos.</li>
<li>Pro one-world government, currency, and religion. Jenkins's surrogate pastor in the book actually calls the idea "from the pit of hell." I have no idea why except for the fact that it's not one-American government, currency, and religion.</li>
<li>War mongerer pretending to want world peace.</li>
<li>Sexually promiscuous. Got Hattie pregnant out of wedlock. Despite giving her a ring he doesn't actually want to settle down with her!</li>
<li>Terrible boyfriend. Orders Rayford to break up with Hattie for him. Actually though, this is much of the plot of <em>Soul Harvest</em>.</li>
<li>Advocates for abortion. Wants Hattie to abort their child and is offering and encouraging worldwide abortions.</li>
<li>Refuses to search for Amanda's downed plane. Amanda is killed in a plane crash and despite Rayford's pleas Carpathia refuses to expend resources to find the plane. This is another plot point that doesn't make sense.</li>
<li>Secretly poisoned Bruce! It is revealed that Carpathia had Bruce Barnes poisoned in Asia which is why he was sick when he got back the US and then died. Why Carpathia would poison Bruce is not clear but I have hope that one day I will understand.</li>
<li>May have been in cahoots with Amanda. I was rather impressed by my roommate's ability to figure this out in <em>Nicolae</em>. Tsion, Buck, Chloe, and Hattie have mysterious evidence (she is Carpathia's lieutenant's cousin) that proves that Amanda may have been a mole. Mac (Rayford's first officer) also might have proof. We await the decoding of Amanda's laptop.</li>
<li>Uses injured Chloe as bait to find Buck and potentially Tsion. Not to worry, Buck and Ken masquerade as Dr. Cameron and Dr. Airplane and rescue Chloe from the terrible hospital.</li>
<li>Plans to eliminate Hattie, unborn child, and Rayford. His henchmen inadvertently almost kill Buck when he pretends to be Rayford.</li>
<li>Poisoned Hattie and unborn child. Planned ahead and figured he would cover his bases by having Hattie poisoned while at the evil reproductive clinic that specializes in cloning and stem cell research.</li>
<li>Has ruined television. There's some weird rant about how everything on tv (except for the news, this was pre-post-truth afterall) is sexual and sinful.</li>
<li><a href="https://hsureads.github.io/bridge-to-carpathia/2016/11/23/guest-post-the-worst-part/"><strike>Is a cat.</strike></a></li>
</ol>

<p>Conclusion: Pure evil. No room for nuance or empathy. Excellent writing.</p>

<p>In other plots the worldwide earthquake killed lots of people and turned many of those who survived into zombies. Not really but there were people staggering around bleeding from all over and asking Buck to kill or save them. Two pilots (Ken Ritz and Mac McCullum, where do they get these names???) became Christians. Buck conveniently found a Christian doctor at the evil GC hospital, he is treating everyone in the Tribulation Force since nearly everyone is injured. Christians now have permanent, but secret and invisible to anyone who is not a believer, Ash Wednesday/visual puzzle marks on their foreheads. Meteors fell and hail, blood, and fire are raining down from the heavens.</p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

**Moment of silence for the dead:** Amanda, Donny the tech guy, and Loretta the southern belle

**Questions for your pastor:**
<ol>
<li>Does our church have a disaster search and rescue team?</li>
<li>Am I the Antichrist if I ghosted my last kind-of relationship?</li>
</ol>

**Current excitement level:** 4. The terrible writing is getting to me. Plus I'm picking up books 7-13 from the library later today.

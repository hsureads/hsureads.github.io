After some much needed respite from <em>Left Behind</em> I picked up the 11th book from the library yesterday and subjected six of my friends to the Kirk Cameron <em>Left Behind</em> followed immediately by the Nicholas Cage <em>Left Behind</em>. Also Amstel Light. It was a strange night. Here's a log of how the evening went.

<ul>
<li><b>6:00 pm:</b> Roommate 1 and I set up the VCR to our TV. We struggle a bit with figuring out if the rewind function is working properly. Also we get a little preview of the Kirk Cameron movie when we play a couple of seconds of it to check image quality. It is horrendous.</li>
<li><b>6:30 pm:</b> The VHS finally finishes rewinding. We think we might have not understood the rewinding functions correctly but whatever. At least we are ready for the marathon.</li>
<li><b>8:00 pm:</li> Post-dinner everyone has arrived. We are standing around eating panna cotta and opening bottles of Amstel Light. How European of us. Mostly we are procrastinating starting the movies. But I struggle with staying up past midnight so I force everyone to sit down and start watching.</p>
<li><b>8:01 pm:</b> Do you remember the days of VHS when you couldn't jump past the trailers to the start menu? This is going to be a longer night than expected.</li>
<li><b>8:02 pm:</b> The first trailer is for another movie about Christian end times. Weird. I didn't know there was such a huge market for this.</li>
<li><b>8:04 pm:</b> Wait. The second trailer is for yet another movie about Christian end times from Cloud Ten Pictures. Does this production company only produce movies about the end times???</li>
<li><b>8:06 pm:</b> Wow. There's yet another and this stars Gary Busey and Howie Mandel with curly hair. But actually. Fascinating.</li>
<li><b>8:08 pm:</b> But wait, there's more! This one has the dad from <em>Psych</em> and Mr. T. No joke. We make plans to watch this at another time.</li>
<li><b>8:10 pm:</b> Ok time for the feature film. Here we go.</li>
<li><b>8:11 pm:</b> My friends discover that they actually know the guy who composed the score for this movie. Does this mean we should refrain from making fun of the score? Fat chance.
<li><b>8:13 pm:</b> Personal thought: "Is that how you pronounce Chaim Rosenzweig???"</li>
<li><b>8:20 pm:</b> The group laughs at the explosions and CGI when Israel is attacked.</li>
<li><b>8:30 pm:</b> Rayford's family is quite something. You can tell that Chloe is rebellious because she has a nose ring and is wearing a choker. For some reason she's not at Stanford though...</li>
<li><b>8:31 pm:</b> But actually just look at everyone's clothes! Yeesh.</li>
<li><b>8:32 pm - 9:30 pm:</b> General guffawing at the lack of production, technological, and acting quality. Also the plot follows way too closely to the novel which means that it makes absolutely no sense. Carpathia's "Romanian" accent sounds like evil Kermit, vaguely Russian/Eastern European. There are a lot of explosions and lurking in shadows by weird men, including Buck who seems to just tag along with Rayford. </li>
<li><b>9:35 pm:</b> There's a weird pop song that plays when someone accepts Jesus. Another friend reveals after humming along said song that she had the soundtrack when she was young. I hang out with a very <em>Left Behind</em>-literate group apparently.</li>
<li><b>9:40 pm:</b> We decide that Carpathia has Jedi mind control abilities. Which he mostly just uses to make everyone in the room say "terribly sad." Ok.</li>
<li><b>9:45 pm:</b> The movie is over! Everyone is relieved. And now also worried. I put the beer outside because it's closer than the fridge and it is freaking 5 degrees out.</li>
<li><b>9:47 pm:</b> Wait. How are we watching the Nicholas Cage version? I thought it was available on Amazon Video but I guess it's only available to rent now. We check all the rest of our streaming options. It is only available to rent and no one is willing to spend money on it. Luckily I find a couple copies on Youtube.</li>
<li><b>9:49 pm:</b> We start one of the Youtube copies. My friends yell at me that there are syncing issues. Ok let's try this other copy.</li>
<li><b>9:50 pm:</b> Well this other copy is super zoomed in. This won't work. I guess we will be watching the movie with slight audio delay.</li>
<li><b>10:00 pm:</b> Chad Michael Murray has weird facial hair. Nicholas Cage has clearly had Botox or something. He can't move his face.</li>
<li><b>10:10 pm:</b> Why do none of these movies do the cookie sharing ritual??? That is all I wanted to see!</li>
<li><b>10:14 pm:</b> Is that the dude that plays Michael Oher from <em>The Blind Side</em>? Yes it is.</li>
<li><b>10:15 pm:</b> Is that Jordin Sparks from <em>American Idol</em>? Yes it is.</li>
<li><b>10:16 pm:</b> Is that the guy from <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>? Yes it is.</li>
<li><b>10:20 pm:</b> I need a beer. Even if it's Amstel Light. This is terrible. Luckily the beer is right outside the door.</li>
<li><b>10:22 pm:</b> When the rapture happens Chloe is hugging Raymie and then suddenly just hugging his clothes without his body. It's creepy and hilarious. We skip back and watch it a couple times.</li>
<li><b>10:30 pm:</b> We're watching a bus flip over the side of a bridge and then the Youtube video jumps back to the scene of the rapture. There's a lot of yelling, both on screen and in the apartment. What is happening? I have to find the correct moment to get back on track.</li>
<li><b>10:40 pm, 10:50 pm, 11:00 pm, 11:10 pm, 11:20 pm:</b> The skip back issue keeps on happening. It mostly involves me running from the couch to the computer and trying to remember the exact moment with skipped from.</li>
<li><b>11:05 pm:</b> Why is Jordin Sparks brandishing a gun? Oh dear.</li>
<li><b>11:14 pm:</b> We collectively agree that there has been less Nicholas Cage yelling than we had hoped for. We talk over the movie about his financial troubles and his weird personal life.</li>
<li><b>11:15 pm:</b> Wait what is Chloe doing on top of a bridge? She is going to commit suicide? Wow this is darker than the books. How much longer do we have?</li>
<li><b>11:16 pm:</b> Now we have no audio at all. This actually makes the movie better.</li>
<li><b>11:17 pm:</b> The audio's back and luckily Buck calls Chloe right before she jumps. She's now on a mission to find them a runway. She steals some dude's motorcycle and is impressively adept at riding it. Then she steals some dude's old pickup truck and starts ramming construction cones out of the way to create a mile long runway. But really not that effectively.</li>
<li><b>11:24 pm:</b> Explosions galore! Chloe is an idiot and would have lit herself on fire but Hollywood doesn't make her pay. Also she informs her dad that she was only able to clear a runway 9/10 of a mile long. Oh the drama.</li>
<li><b>11:33 pm:</b> I run to the computer because it seems like the skipping issue is happening again but no! The video is just refusing to play. We are so close to the end, Nicholas Cage landed the plane inches from a propane tank and people are sliding down the emergency exit slides. Now I have to search for yet another Youtube copy of this stupid movie. Actually, why are there so many copies of this movie?</li>
<li><b>11:35 pm:</b> Found one! I navigate to the correct time marker and the movie begins again. It's like at 1.5x speed so everyone sounds like a chipmunk! I'm crying laughing. The evening has been redeemed.</li>
</ul>

So that's that. If you feel like watching either of the films I have embedded them below. Stay tuned for my final entries about the last three books. As a reminder I have reneged on my initial promise to read the prequels and am ending this exercise in discipline and punishment after reading the 13th book.

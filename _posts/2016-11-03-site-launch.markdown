If you know anything about me, I spend a large portion of my day scouring the internet for interesting and (hopefully) well-written articles. I have always loved learning and ever since graduating college it has been up to me to find things to learn about. I enjoy sharing my findings with friends and given the current social media and political climate I think it is increasingly important to share thoughtful content and not just clickbait. I am going to attempt to curate my best readings each week and share them in a public Trello board and here. Please take a look around, read about things and experiences that you might be unfamiliar with, and share your own finds.

**Disclaimer: These articles are curated by me and thus will often reflect my own interests, beliefs, and biases. I don't pretend to be objective but hopefully we can have honest and kind discussions about our differences. I would love it if you shared well-written opposition views.

Given my current lifestyle I spend a good part of my day scouring the internet for interesting and (hopefully) well-written articles. I know that many of my friends are on the same search for content. This is an attempt at making a note of my favorite articles of each week and sharing it with people who want more than clickbait.

Thanks to John Otander for the Jekyll theme (https:/github.com/johnotander/pixyll.

Given my current lifestyle I spend a good part of my day scouring the internet for interesting and (hopefully) well-written articles. I know that many of my friends are on the same search for content. This is an attempt at making a note of my favorite articles of each week and sharing it with people who want more than clickbait.

I don't have much of an interest in providing a ton of commentary, hence "blog," but if you are interested in discussing articles please head over to the appropriate Trello card and leaving a comment. You can also get realtime updates on what I'm reading by following my public Trello boards (https://trello.com/hsureads) or finding me on Pocket (https://getpocket.com/@hsureads).

Thanks to John Otander for the Jekyll theme (https:/github.com/johnotander/pixyll).

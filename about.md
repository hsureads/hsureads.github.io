I spend a good part of my day scouring the internet for interesting and (hopefully) well-written articles. I know that many of my friends are on the same search for worthwhile content. This is an attempt at making a note of my favorite articles of each week and sharing it with people who want more than clickbait.

I don't have much of an interest in providing a ton of commentary, hence "blog," but if you are interested in discussing articles please head over to the appropriate Trello card and leave a comment. You can also get realtime updates on what I'm reading by following my public Trello boards (<a href="https://trello.com/hsureads">https://trello.com/hsureads</a>) or finding me on Pocket (<a href="https://getpocket.com/@hsureads">https://getpocket.com/@hsureads</a>).

Thanks to John Otander for the Jekyll theme (<a href="https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll">https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll</a>).
